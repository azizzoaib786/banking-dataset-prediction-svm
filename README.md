# SVM (Support Vector Machine) - Banking Credit Card Eligibility Prediction

## Overview
This project utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification model to predict customer eligibility for banking credit cards. It employs various data preprocessing techniques, visualizations, and model optimization strategies to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Project Goals
- Accurately classify customers based on their eligibility for credit cards.
- Explore and visualize data relationships to understand customer attributes influencing eligibility.
- Optimize the SVM model using hyperparameter tuning and handling data imbalance effectively.

## Steps Included

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data exploration and cleaning
- Identifying key features and their impact

### 2. Data Visualization
- Correlation analysis using Heatmap
- Understanding feature relationships and data distribution

### 3. Data Scaling
- Standardization to ensure optimal model performance

### 4. Model Implementation
- SVM (Support Vector Machine) classification

### 5. Hyperparameter Optimization
- Searching optimal hyperparameters through sampling techniques to improve model accuracy

### 6. Handling Class Imbalance
- Implementation of SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- Addressing data imbalance to enhance predictive performance

### 7. Post-SMOTE Hyperparameter Optimization
- Further refining the SVM model post-balancing for improved accuracy
