# SVM (Suppurt Vector Machine) - Banking Credit Cards Eligibility Prediction

The goal of this notebook is to use SVM classification model on banking dataset to classify the customers if they are eligible for credit card or not?

## Steps

1. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
2. Data Visualizations using Heatmap
3. Data Scaling using Standardization
4. Model Implementation using SVM
5. Hyperparameters Search using sampling (to improve accuracy)
6. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) Process
7. Hyperparameters Search after SMOTE
